Hi there!  Thanks for visiting the About page...  I'm not yet sure how I'd like to organize the page, so the information here has no purposeful order.

I've been a Trek fan since age 8, when my parents introduced me to The Next Generation.
The optimistic and principled attitudes of many characters in the franchise is powerful- these are likely the reasons why I adore the series so much.

Making this quiz is my first venture into programming, so it's likely neither efficient nor flawless.  If you have any suggestions about the code and/or structure of the quiz, don't hesitate to contact me using the "spotted an error?" form linked below.

My goal is to provide a template for Star Trek trivia questions that welcomes questions from the whole community.  If you've got a question in mind, please submit it with the "contribute a question!" form.  It's also linked down below.

All information should be verifiable on Memory Alpha (aka. questions should be Canon).

The computation relies heavily on the added functionality of EMCAScript6 (over the prior EMCAScript5), so if the game isn't running well in your browser, ES6 might be the culprit.

If you've got something super specific that you'd like to tell me, use the form down below called "other".  I haven't set up an email yet, but it's on the list of things to do.
