      <h2>The Quiz</h2>
        <p>There's a lot of trivia about the Trek franchise scattered throughout the web.
          I'm hoping trektrivia.com can become a place where that trivia (and more) can centralize, so Trekkies can flock here to get their dose of trivia and flex their muscles.
          The site is built to accommodate a vast number of questions and relies on constant user submission to keep the questions fresh.
        </p>

      <h2>Writing a Question</h2>
        <p>I've tried my best to phrase many questions in this format: <br>
          <br>
          <i>Captain Picard prefers <u>this</u> type of tea.</i> <br>
          <br>
          Where "<i>this</i>" represents the correct answer.
          This seems like an eloquent and easy way to frame a question. <br>
          <br>
          The hardest part is brainstorming <u>plausible</u> alternative responses.
          When you're writing a question, try to pick a topic that seems conducive to alternatives. <br>
          <br>
          All information should be verifiable on Memory Alpha (i.e. questions should be <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" target = "_blank">canon</a>).
        </p>

      <h2>Links</h2>
        <p>If I reference a link, it's probably here.</p>

      <h2>About the Creator</h2>
        <p>I've been a Trek fan since primary school, when my parents introduced me to The Next Generation.
          DS9 shortly followed and became my favorite series.
          The optimistic and principled attitudes of many characters in the franchise are powerful; this optimism is likely the reason why I adore the series so much.</p>

        <p>Making this quiz is my first venture into programming, so it's neither efficient nor flawless, and I'd welcome feedback.
          If you have any suggestions about the code and/or structure of the quiz, don't hesitate to message me using the form linked above.</p>

      <h2>Notes...</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I tend to misspell things... if you find an error, submit it <a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbsGV9TFulqs7wgHzGz0jiaeohTpK2QL4gHe8Seb59dTz1ew/viewform?usp=sf_link" target = "_blank">here</a>.</li>
          <li>Questions about TOS, ENT, DIS, and PIC are in short supply! If you know these series well, please submit some questions about them!</li>
          <li>If you've got a suggestion for a different font (perhaps one with a more futurisic vibe), send me an message using the link above!</li>
          <li>This quiz relies heavily on the added functionality of EMCAScript6 (over the prior ES5). If the game isn't running, your browser's support for ES6 is likely the culprit.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Coming soon...</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>An original Favicon! If you've got ideas, message me! I threw the current one together in Illustrator in an attempt to recreate the disks from TNG's "<a href = "https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Game_(episode)" target = "_blank">The Game</a>."</li>
          <li>Keypress functionality for answering questions (this actually already exists, but animations are lacking. Try using 1, 2, 3, and 4).</li>
          <li>An option to be prompted with questions sourced from movies corresponding to the chosen series.</li>
          <li>A percentile ranking for your score...</li>
          <li>A version optimized for mobile...</li>
          <li>A cleaner About page.</li>
        </ul>
